# remote server setup
    - should be suitable for pushing to railway from GitHub

## The remoe server/dev environment should 
    - include node with typescript support.
    - be able to create a 'hello world' app running remotely on railway using 
    - a linter
    - testing support suitable for TDD

## decisions
    - should vs code be installed on railway or should vs code simply edit code on railway
    - I don't need any cutting edge node or typescript features. what are good versions of typescript and node that will probably work with most current node libraries? 
    - which lint support?
    - which testing support?

## key consideration:
    - I want to be able to do simple things using a mobile device and an agentic model such as Claude code, codex, or Factory.ai's droid. Since the optimal tool will probably change, flexibility is a key consideration. But, another consideration is time to get some development underway. We need a balance between forward looking and time to first app,
